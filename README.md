Demo: [Fan Portals](http://fanportals.herokuapp.com/)

Fan Portals was the culmination of 12 weeks of study in the Iron Yard's Full Stack program. 

The project was created as a place for fans of anything to gather together or find each other.  

Perhaps you're a sports fan from out of town?
Where do you go to find the local fans?  Where do they meet at?

Maybe you and other fans of Doctor Who are planning on attending a convention and want to coordinate your cosplay!

What if you're a local coordinator of a fandom? Let people know that you have events going on.

Here's what you can do with Fan Portals:
* Create a portal
* Populate your portal with information about your fandom
* Create events on your portal
* Want to attend an event? Let them know you're going to attend!
* Follow other portals
